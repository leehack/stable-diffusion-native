# stable-diffusion-native

Native build and release pipeline for
[stable-diffusion.cpp](https://github.com/leejet/stable-diffusion.cpp) runtime
libraries.

## Purpose

This repository owns the platform-specific stable-diffusion.cpp payload
consumed by [llamadart](https://github.com/leehack/llamadart) and other
wrappers. It stays independent from `llamadart` so the artifacts can be reused
elsewhere.

- Pin an upstream stable-diffusion.cpp commit as a submodule.
- Build one shared library per platform with upstream's C API
  (`stable-diffusion.h`) as the FFI boundary.
- Export only that API. stable-diffusion.cpp embeds its own patched ggml;
  hiding it lets the library share a process with another ggml, such as
  llama.cpp's.
- Publish runtime archives, unstripped symbol archives, `manifest.json` and
  `SHA256SUMS`.

The Dart API, model presets and download/cache logic stay in downstream
packages such as `llamadart`.

## Targets

| Target | Library | Acceleration | Built on |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `macos-arm64` | `libstable-diffusion.dylib` | Metal, CPU | macOS |
| `macos-x64` | `libstable-diffusion.dylib` | Metal, CPU | macOS |
| `ios-arm64` | `libstable-diffusion.dylib` | Metal, CPU | macOS |
| `ios-arm64-sim` | `libstable-diffusion.dylib` | Metal, CPU | macOS |
| `android-arm64` | `libstable-diffusion.so` | CPU | any, with the NDK |
| `linux-x64` | `libstable-diffusion.so` | CPU | Linux x64 |
| `linux-arm64` | `libstable-diffusion.so` | CPU | Linux arm64 |
| `windows-x64` | `stable-diffusion.dll` | CPU | Windows x64 |

Minimums: macOS 13.3, iOS 16.4, Android API 28. The Android build requires
Armv8.2 dot-product and fp16 support (Cortex-A55/A75 or newer); consumers
should check for `asimddp` before loading it.

Android GPU backends are not shipped. On tested devices, Vulkan crashed in
the Adreno 750 driver's shader compiler and on a null `vkGetBufferDeviceAddress`
on Mali-G68, and OpenCL on Adreno 750 was slower than the CPU.

## Build

```bash
git submodule update --init --recursive
python3 tools/build.py list
python3 tools/build.py build --target macos-arm64
python3 tools/validate_artifacts.py
python3 tools/package_release.py --tag v0.1.0
```

Android builds need the NDK (`ANDROID_NDK_HOME`, or the newest NDK under
`ANDROID_HOME`). `build --target all-host` builds every target the current host
supports.

Outputs:

- `bin/<target>/lib/`: stripped runtime library.
- `bin/<target>/symbols/`: unstripped library for crash symbolication.
- `bin/<target>/include/stable-diffusion.h` and `build-info.json`.
- `dist/`: release archives, `manifest.json`, `SHA256SUMS`.

## Release

Run the `Native Build & Release` workflow with a tag such as `v0.1.0`. Tags are
`vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`, with an optional `-N` rebuild counter starting at 1
(`v0.1.0-2`). Each release records the upstream commit in `manifest.json`.

Archive names:

- `stable-diffusion-native-runtime-<target>-<tag>.tar.gz`
- `stable-diffusion-native-symbols-<target>-<tag>.tar.gz`

## License

MIT. Release archives include the stable-diffusion.cpp and ggml licenses.
